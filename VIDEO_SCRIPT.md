**Scene: Modern DeFi Dashboard with Privacy Concerns**

### Act 2: Technology Deep Dive (1:30 - 3:00)

2. Computations on encrypted data
3. Results remaining encrypted until authorized decryption

**Narrator continues:**

**Visual: Code snippets showing FHE operations:**
```javascript
// Encrypt investment amount
const encryptedAmount = await fhe.encrypt(investmentAmount);

// Perform computation on encrypted data
const encryptedTotal = fhe.add(encryptedAmount, currentTotal);

// Result stays encrypted
```
